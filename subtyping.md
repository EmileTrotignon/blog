# Subtyping and Variance

Subtyping is a powerful concept that feels very intuitive but has weird
consequences. These consequences are often referred to by the complicated terms
"covariance" and "contravariance". I will explain what this means bellow.

## Introduction: OCaml notations

I will use notations from the OCaml langage. You may skip this section if you
are familiar with it.

- `val v : t` means that there is value `v` that has type `t`.
- `a -> b` is the type of functions that take an argument of type `a` and return
  a value of type `b`.
- `f a` is the application of the function `f` to the value `a`.
- A type `'a t` has a parameter `'a`. You can put any type in it, for instance
  `int t` or `string t` are both valid types.

## Basics

"`A` is a subtype of `B`" is written `A < B` and means that where we need a
value of type `B`, providing a value of type `A` instead is fine.

In OOP vocabulary, we would say that `A` inherits `B`, but there are other kinds
of subtyping than OOP-style inheritance: in OCaml, subtyping shows up with
classes but also polymorphic variants.

If `A < B`, then a value of type `A` can be considered to be a value of type `B`.

Let us consider the example of the types `square` and `rectangle`.
Naturally, we have `square < rectangle`.
If you have:

```ocaml
val f : rectangle -> int

val v : square
```

then `f v` is well-typed.
Depending on the language, some kind of explicit instruction to consider that
`v` is of type `Rectangle` may be needed.

## Covariance

Lets imagine that we have the following values:

```ocaml
val high1 : (int -> square) -> square

val high2 : (int -> rectangle) -> square

val f : int -> square

val g : int -> rectangle
```

If you are unfamiliar with this notation : `high1` takes a function as argument,
this function has to have type `int -> square`.

It is very clear that `high1 f` is well typed, and same is true for `high2 g`.
The question is whether `high1 g` or `high2 f` are well typed.

Let's not try to resolve typing2 at first, and just study what will happen if we
actually run the code.

If we run `high1 g`, what will happen is that `high1` will be allowed to call
`g`, and consider its result as a `square`. However the result of `g` is not
necesseraly a `square`, it may be any `rectangle`. Therefore `high1 g` is
ill-typed.

If we run `high2 f`, what will happen is that `high2` will be allowed to call
`f`, and consider its result as a `rectangle`. Since the results of `f` are
`square` and `square < rectangle`, this is well-typed.

This means that if `square < rectangle`, then
`(int -> square) < (int -> rectangle)`.

We call this situation covariance.

More precisely, the function type `a -> b` is covariant with `a`, because it
"varies" in the same direction as `a`.

Here, variation means "accepting a sub- or super-type", and the direction is
whether we are talking a sub-type or a super-type.

## Contravariance

Lets imagine that we have the following values:

```ocaml
val high1 : (square -> int) -> int

val high2 : (rectangle -> int) -> int

val f : square -> int

val g : rectangle -> int
```

Once again, it is very clear that `high1 f` is well typed, and same is true for
`high2 g`. The question is whether `high1 g` or `high2 f` are well typed.

When we run `high2 f`, what will happen is that `high2` will be allowed to call
`g : square -> int` with an argument of type `rectangle`. This is an error.

When we run`high1 g`, what will happen is that `high1` will be allowed to call
`g : rectangle -> int` with an argument of type `square`. This is fine.

This means that if `square < rectangle`, then
`(rectangle -> int) < (square -> int)`, because a function with an argument of
type `(square -> int)` can be called value of type `(rectangle -> int)`.

We call this situation contravariance.

More precisely, the function type `a -> b` is contravariant with `b`, because it
"varies" in the opposite direction as `b`.

## Invariance

This time, we will ask the question of the type `ref`.

In OCaml, `t ref` designated a mutable variable of type `t`.

In essence, a mutable value is a pair of a setter function and a getter
function. We can write this the following way:

```ocaml
type 'a ref = {get: unit -> 'a; set: 'a -> unit}
```

What we want to know is, assuming `square < rectangle`, can we assert
`square ref < rectangle ref` or `rectangle ref < square ref`?

By applying the results of the two above paragraphs, we can already conclude
that the answer is no. Both assertions are false. Lets show it in a more
convincing by example.

Lets assume the following environment:

```ocaml
val new_rectangle : unit -> rectangle
val new_square : unit -> square

val print_rectangle : rectangle -> unit
val print_square : square -> unit
```

We will now write the following function :

```ocaml
let set_to_new r =
  r.set (new_rectangle ())

let print_rectangle_ref r =
  print_rectangle (r.get ())

let print_square_ref r =
  print_square (r.get ())
```

These functions have the following types :

```ocaml
val set_to_new : rectangle ref -> unit

val print_rectangle_ref : rectangle ref -> unit
val print_square_ref : square ref -> unit
```

If we assume that `rectangle ref < square ref`, then we may pass an argument of
type `rectangle ref` to `print_square_ref`. This will obviously fail, the
printer for squares cannot print a rectangle. Therefore we do not have
`rectangle ref < square ref`.

If we assume that `square ref < rectangle ref`, then we may pass an argument of
type `square ref` to `set_to_new`. This break the typing, because then the
`square ref` will contain a rectangle obtained from `new_rectangle` that is not
necessary a `square`. Therefore we do not have `square ref < rectangle ref`.

We have neither `rectangle ref < square ref` nor `square ref < rectangle ref`.
We say that the type `a ref` type is invariant with `a`, because if `a` "varies"
(that is accepts a super- or sub-type), then `a ref` does not.

Notice that any type `'a t` that contains a mutable field of type `'a` is going
to be invariant for the same reason. This is especially important for the type
`array`.

## Java

In this section, I will start rambling about how aweful Java is.

Java consider its array type to be covariant. We saw earlier that it is in
fact invariant. This means that some typing errors will manifest themselves at
runtime.

For instance, if you have an array of squares, you may pass it to a function
expecting an array of rectangle. If the function tries to write a rectangle to
the array, an exception will be triggered. This is in my opinion a very bad
situation. Whether a function will write to an array or not is not necessarely
apparent from its interface, and it must happens quite often that unexpected
exception are raised, when a more powerful type system would have eliminated
them.

I do understand that in a language such as Java, where subtyping is really
pervasive (that is a mistake by itself in my opinion, but beyond the scope of
this discussion), you need to be able to use subtyping with arrays. Arrays being
invariant makes them "incompatible" with subtyping, and this is a definitely an
issue that needs to be solved. There is however a quite easy way to solve it,
that does not involve making the type system incomplete.

Remember that the `'a ref` was defined as such earlier:

```ocaml
type 'a ref = {get: unit -> 'a; set: 'a -> unit}
```

Using the same idea we can define the array type as such:

```ocaml
type 'a array = {get: int -> 'a; set: 'a -> int -> unit; length: int}
```

We need to pass integers for the indexes. Out of bounds errors will be handled
by an exception.

With this definition, we once agan see why `'a array` is invariant in `'a`.

However, we can also notice that the type of `get` is covariant in `'a`, and the
type of `set` is contravariant. An array type deprived of its set function will
therefore be covariant, and an array type deprived of its get function will be
contravariant.

We can write:

```ocaml
type 'a read_only_array = {get: int -> 'a; length: int}
type 'a write_only_array = {set: 'a -> int -> unit; length: int}

let make_read_only (arr : 'a array) : 'a read_only_array =
  {get=arr.get; length=arr.length}

let make_write_only (arr : 'a array) : 'a write_only_array =
  {set=arr.set; length=arr.length}
```

And then we can convert arrays to either write only or read only, and use them
as covariant or contravariant types.

Lets look at at example.

```ocaml
val squares : square array
val rectangles : rectangle array

let print_rect_array (arr: rectangle read_only_array) : unit =
  for i=0 to arr.length - 1 do
    print_rect (arr.get (i))
  done

let reset_square_array (arr: square write_only_array) : unit =
  for i=0 to arr.length - 1 do
    arr.set (new_square ()) i
  done
```

Here you can use both functions on both `squares` and `rectangles`:

```ocaml
let main () =
  (* directly well-typed *)
  print_rect_array (read_only_array rectangles) ;
  (* well-typed by covariance *)
  print_rect_array (read_only_array square) ;

  (* directly well-typed *)
  reset_square_array (write_only_array squares) ;
  (* well-typed by contravariance *)
  reset_square_array (write_only_array rectangle)
```

A more powerful type system would make the calls to `write_only_array` and
`read_only_array` implicit (they would be language construction instead of
regular functions). This would be very comfortable to use, and I believe this is
what Java should have done.

This type system would allow to following syntax:

```ocaml
val squares : square array
val rectangles : rectangle array

let print_rect_array (read_only arr: rectangle array) : unit =
  for i=0 to arr.length - 1 do
    print_rect (arr.get (i))
  done

let reset_square_array (write_only arr: square array) : unit =
  for i=0 to arr.length - 1 do
    arr.set (new_square ()) i
  done

let main () =
  (* directly well-typed *)
  print_rect_array rectangles ;
  (* well-typed by covariance *)
  print_rect_array square ;

  (* directly well-typed *)
  reset_square_array squares ;
  (* well-typed by contravariance *)
  reset_square_array rectangle
```

I am not sure how exactly such a type system would be implemented, but it is
still funny to notice that there are probably subtyping relationships between
`'a array`, `'a read_only_array` and `'a write_only_array`. This of course
depends on the variance of `'a`.
